# Hubitat Apps and Drivers
Apps and Drivers I've created for Hubitat Elevation

# Drivers
The drivers to be used are under 'drivers/expanded', the drivers directly in 'drivers' can't be used on HE. They contain code generation blocks executed by the Python scripts to create the final drivers residing in 'expanded'.

NOTE: 'tasmota-tuya-wifi-touch-switch-child-test' is NOT a real driver, do NOT use it.

# Apps
The apps to be used are under 'apps/expanded', the apps directly in 'apps' can't be used on HE. They contain code generation blocks executed by the Python scripts to create the final apps residing in 'expanded'.

"Tasmota Connect" is used to install these drivers on HE.

NOTE: 'tasmota-connect-test' is NOT a real app, do NOT use it.

# Python scripts
The Python scripts used for generating the expanded source code and auto-publish to Hubitat are not meant to be used, but I have published them in case they are of some use to anyone. If you do use them, look me up at the Hubitat Forum user "markus" and I will happily listen to any feedback you may have.
